### Example I

**Date**  
2014-07-20, Sunday

**Event**  
2 events: [time] 13:00-16:00, 17:00-20:00  
[Category] Dinosaur Show  
**[Summary]** The spectacular production, *Walking With Dinosaurs* features 20 life-size dinosaurs, including the Tyrannosaurus rex, Plateosaurus, and Brachiosaurus

**True Demand**  
`[pickup] 399` `[dropoff] 253`

**GBDT's results**  
`[pickup] 483` `[dropoff] 304`

**LLM-MPE's results**  
`[pickup] 410` `[dropoff] 260`  
**[reasoning]** The historical average demand for a Sunday is 426 pickups and 247 dropoffs. The event, *Walking With Dinosaurs*, has been running for the past few days. Comparing the demand on these days with the historical average, we see a slight decrease in pickups and a slight increase in dropoffs.  
Considering the event is still popular but has been running for a few days, we can expect a similar pattern. Therefore, I predict a slight decrease in pickups to 410 and a slight increase in dropoffs to 260.
